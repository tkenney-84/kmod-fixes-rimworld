!!! UPDATED FOR 1.4 !!!

The reduced meal cost feature has been transitioned to a separate mod.
You can find it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215743464

PLANS:

- Compatibility issues will be resolved eventually.
- Support for all expansions is complete, there have just been difficulties getting it implemented. So it is not present for now, as I want the 1.4 release out.

COMPATIBILITY:
- Compatible with versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.
- Incompatible with any mods that make any modifications to the base-game stats on the flammability adjustments list.

CHANGES:

- Set standing lamps power consumption from 30 to 5.
- Set sun lamps power consumption from 2900 to 500.
- Brewery can now be made out of wood or metal. (Fireproofing)
- Fermenting Barrels can now be made of wood or metal. (Fireproofing)
- Watermill Generator can now be made of wood or metal. (Fireproofing)
- Passive Cooler can now be made of wood, stone, or metal. (Fireproofing)
- Heavy bridges can now be constructed. They can support heavy structures and are fireproof, but just as weak as wooden bridges. This was not my choice, the threshhold for destruction is based on explosive damage and everything appears to do 50. the threshhold for heavy bridges is set to 50 (whereas bridges are 35) but it appears to make no functional difference.
- Flammability reduced/eliminated on certain objects. Details on specific objects can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZE_NnfwESUzPr2ALhBh3u1pVWCNiGAK58ALiMqkwjP8/edit?usp=sharing
